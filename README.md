# Portfolio-Website
A responsive portfolio website built using Tailwind CSS, showcasing my web development projects and skills. Explore my work and feel free to collaborate or provide feedback!

## Warning!
To fully explore the features of this responsive website, please refer to the video demo below for instructions on how to run and utilize Tailwind CSS on your device.

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/arftp8kFBBg?si=pU7eM2Etf1tvjC4C

I recommend watching the video demonstration first before downloading any files, as it will guide you through creating your own **package.json** file and other necessary steps. Follow the instructions, then download the files from this repo. Replace them in the appropriate folder, and youâ€™ll be able to run the responsive website.

Once you have the **node_modules** folder, you're all set to run this program built with Tailwind CSS.
